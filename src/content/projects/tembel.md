## Key features ✨

- 🤖 AI curriculum generation using Google Gemini with intelligent goal analysis
- 📚 Structured learning modules with comprehensive content and objectives
- 🎯 Interactive exercises (multiple choice & reflection) with progressive difficulty
- 🏆 Final projects that apply learned knowledge practically
- 💰 Coin-based economy with payment integration for premium features

## How it works 🔄

1. **Goal Setting**: Users input their learning objective (e.g., "Learn React hooks", "Master SQL basics")
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes the goal and determines if it's specific enough or needs clarification
3. **Curriculum Generation**: AI creates a structured learning plan with 3-10 modules, each containing:
   - Learning objectives and "why it matters" explanations
   - Comprehensive content with key takeaways and common pitfalls
   - 3-12 interactive exercises with progressive difficulty
   - Estimated completion time
4. **Learning Journey**: Users progress through modules, complete exercises, and track their advancement
5. **Final Project**: Capstone project that applies all learned concepts with clear requirements and criteria
