```

1. Now, we have to login to our vercel account
    
    ```bash

    ```

2. Choose your login method

    Congratulations! You are now logged in. In order to deploy something, run `vercel`.
    üí°  Connect your Git Repositories to deploy every branch push automatically (https://vercel.link/git).
    ```

## Deploy the project

I have initiate a simple vite project, now we can use that project to deploy to vercel

1. Go to the project directory

    ```bash
    ‚ûú  cd vite-project
    ```

2. Deploy the project

    ```bash
    ‚ûú  vercel
    ```
    
    ```bash
    Vercel CLI 32.5.3
    ? Set up and deploy ‚Äú~/vite-project‚Äù? [Y/n] y
    ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? fachrihawari
    ? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
    ? What‚Äôs your project‚Äôs name? vite-project
    ? In which directory is your code located? ./
    Local settings detected in vercel.json:
    Auto-detected Project Settings (Vite):
    - Build Command: vite build
    - Development Command: vite --port $PORT
    - Install Command: `yarn install`, `pnpm install`, `npm install`, or `bun install`
    - Output Directory: dist
    ? Want to modify these settings? [y/N] n
    üîó  Linked to fachrihawari/vite-project (created .vercel and added it to .gitignore)
    üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/fachrihawari/vite-project/8Ljqz2qXVD8WrZrKzNno2S3ggQyc [1s]
    ‚úÖ  Preview: https://vite-project-h69n7296j-fachrihawari.vercel.app [1s]
    üìù  Deployed to production. Run `vercel --prod` to overwrite later (https://vercel.link/2F).
    üí°  To change the domain or build command, go to https://vercel.com/fachrihawari/vite-project/settings
    ```

3. Actually the project is already deployed but it's a preview deployment, if you want to deploy it to production you can run this command

    ```bash
    ‚ûú  vercel --prod
    ```

    ```bash
    Vercel CLI 32.5.3
    üîç  Inspect: https://vercel.com/fachrihawari/vite-project/ExLzvwecK2xBLMNsGZMW6eaePhHK [1s]
    ‚úÖ  Production: https://vite-project-ozpch580d-fachrihawari.vercel.app [1s]
    ```
